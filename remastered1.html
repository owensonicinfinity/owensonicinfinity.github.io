    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>We are building on 25+ years of research and development, leveraging decades of DIY innovation and independent experimentation across engineering, materials science, electronics, and product design. Every lesson learned, every prototype tested, and every failure experienced contributes to the product you see today.</p>

    <h3>Past Successes (and Lessons Learned)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High-Performance Clutch for Minibike Engines:</strong> Designed and built a superior clutch that outperformed standard options. Unfortunately, the design was copied and commercially exploited by others, teaching us the importance of IP protection and secure development.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Steel Mill Sampler:</strong> Developed the largest-ever sampler capable of extracting 8 lbs of molten steel—a breakthrough in cost reduction and efficiency for the steel industry. Despite its success, red tape and corporate barriers prevented full adoption. These experiences shaped our approach to protecting innovation while ensuring deliverable products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We’re Offering</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to consolidate the best of all previous innovations into a single, fully functional, high-quality product package. We aim to deliver the most advanced, reliable, and user-focused solution possible.</p>

    <h3>Risks & Transparency</h3>
    <p>Despite our experience and preparation, all new product development carries risks. Some components, features, or experiments may not perform as expected, and unforeseen challenges may arise.</p>

    <h3>Failure Protocol</h3>
    <p>If the project cannot be delivered as promised, every backer will receive a full refund.<br>
    <span class="warning">No excuses. No spin. No vague promises.</span><br>
    Communication will be transparent and prompt. You will always know where the project stands.</p>

    <h3>Timeline Flexibility</h3>
    <p>We’ve built an extended timeline into the campaign to account for experimentation and component delivery.<br>
    Your support allows us to explore, refine, and perfect the product without cutting corners.</p>

    <h3>Our Track Record</h3>
    <p>Over 25 years of independent R&D, including DIY engineering breakthroughs, custom prototypes, and unique system designs.<br>
    Past successes like the mini-bike clutch and steel mill sampler prove our capability and vision, even when history didn’t allow commercial realization.<br>
    Every project we’ve undertaken has informed and improved the next.<br>
    This is the culmination of decades of work, now packaged for public support.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This is not just a product. It’s 25 years of innovation, curated, tested, and optimized for real-world performance. If we fail to deliver, you get your funds back, no questions asked. That’s the only guarantee that matters.</p>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Legal Fuck-You Clause:</strong> Copy our shit, steal our designs, rip off our IP, or try to sue us over this public declaration of blood-earned experience—and we’ll sue your ass so hard your grandkids will be paying legal fees. We’ll drag your name through every forum, every thread, every fucking subreddit till your reputation’s thinner than toilet paper on a dick. You’ll wish you’d just jerked off in peace instead of fucking with real builders.
