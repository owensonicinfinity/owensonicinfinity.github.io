  <h1><span class="accent">Daisy OS</span></h1>
  <p>
    Daisy OS is a unified operating shell designed to replace fragmented systems,
    broken workflows, and outdated control layers. Daisy AI is not an add-on.
    It is embedded at the core of the operating system itself.
  </p>
</header>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What Daisy OS Is</h2>
  <p>
    Daisy OS is a master control layer that sits above hardware, software, and data.
    It consolidates command, identity, logic, automation, and intelligence into a
    single operating environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of stitching together platforms, plugins, barcodes, QR systems, APIs,
    dashboards, and third-party tools, Daisy OS replaces the entire mess with one
    coherent system.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Daisy AI (Core Intelligence)</h2>
  <p>
    Daisy AI operates inside Daisy OS as a persistent, system-level intelligence.
    It observes, learns, optimizes, and executes across every connected layer.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>System Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Daisy AI understands how systems actually function, not how documentation
        claims they do. It identifies inefficiencies, redundancies, and failure points
        in real time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Adaptive Control</h3>
      <p>
        Business logic, workflows, permissions, and operations can be restructured
        instantly without rebuilding infrastructure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Embedded Decision Engine</h3>
      <p>
        Daisy AI does not wait for commands. It anticipates needs, flags problems,
        and executes corrections before damage or cost escalates.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Unified Identity & Code Standardization</h2>
  <p>
    Daisy OS replaces fragmented QR codes, UPCs, barcodes, and tracking systems
    with a unified operating identity layer.
  </p>
  <p>
    This eliminates cross-platform incompatibility and removes friction between
    manufacturers, distributors, platforms, and end users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system was designed to reduce operational drag, cut cost, and simplify
    adoption from small shops to enterprise-scale operations.
  </p>

  <h2>Active R&D Streams</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Daisy OS Core</h3>
      <p>
        Continuous development of the master shell, security layers, modular
        expansion, and real-time system orchestration.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Daisy AI Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Ongoing work on adaptive reasoning, long-term system memory,
        predictive modeling, and autonomous optimization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Hardware Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Native integration with phones, wearables, smart glasses, earbuds,
        and next-generation personal devices.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>New Materials & Cost Reduction</h3>
      <p>
        Development of advanced materials designed to outperform carbon fiber
        while drastically reducing cost and complexity.

<section class="section">
  <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Daisy OS is built from first principles. Systems are dismantled,
    understood, and rebuilt properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is not to chase trends or extract short-term profit.
    The goal is to build systems that actually work, scale cleanly,
    and remain stable under pressure.
